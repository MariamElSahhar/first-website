# Throwback
Recreating the first-ever page I wrote in my life over summer between 7 and 8th grade. As true to memory as I can.

## Tools
- Plain HTML and CSS 🌸
- Freedom of middle school summer ☀️
- My dad's generous 25$ sponsorship of my web development courses on Treehouse.com 🐸
- Dream of becoming a freelance web developer to make enough money to travel the world ✈️

## Fun Facts
Back in the day, I didn't know anything about git so I memorized the website (not that there's much to it) and would recreate it in real-time (5 minutes) to show my friends.
I hope Treehouse.com added a git module to their course.
