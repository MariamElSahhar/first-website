# Throwback 🌀
In honor of its 10-year anniversary, recreating the first-ever webpage I wrote in my life over the summer between 7 and 8th grade. As true to memory as I can.

## Tools 🛠️
- 🌸 Plain HTML and CSS 
- ☀️ Freedom of middle school summer
- 🐸 My dad's generous 25$ sponsorship of my web development courses on [teamtreehouse.com](https://teamtreehouse.com/)
- ✈️ Dream of becoming a freelance web developer to make enough money to travel the world

### Fun Fact 🐮
13-year-old me didn't know anything about git so I'd memorize the website (not that there's much to it) and recreate it in real-time (like 4 minutes ?) to show my friends.
I hope Treehouse.com added a git module to their course.
